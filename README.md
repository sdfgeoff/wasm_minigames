# WASM Games From Scratch

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/sdfgeoff/wasm_minigames.svg?branch=master)

I got interested in shader toy a little while back, and enjoyed the ease
of creating shader games: you type and it happens. I wanted to bring the
same experience to normal game development, so decided to create games in WASM
using Rust. They're easy to make, easy to share.

This book documents my progress as I learn how to do so. The book (and
games made along the way) are hosted up at:
